        Once all participants are done with the study, you will receive your bonus through Prolific.
        The final amount is a combination of the number you reported of one die selected at random in stage 1,
        and the bonus from the points you decided to keep depending on how many the other participant sent to you.
        This can take a couple of weeks.
