    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Interaction with a participant from another study</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Now, you are matched with <b>a new participant from a different study</b>.
        We refer to this participant as "Participant C".
        <li>Participant C will now see <u>only one</u> of your randomly selected die roll,
        <u>as well as</u> the number you reported for that roll.
        <li>Based on this information, they will have the opportunity to send points to you.
        <li>Every point they send is tripled by the computer: 1 point sent becomes 3 points received.
        <li>You then decide how many points from those, if any, to return to them.
        <li>You can return nothing, some, or all points.
    </ul>

        Example:
        <ul>
            <li>If they send all 3 points, you will receive 9 points.
            <li>If you return half of the 9 points, you and Participant C will both earn 4.5 points,
            and will both have more than you started with.
            <li>If you return nothing, they will earn 9 points, while you will earn nothing.
        </ul>

        Your bonus will be the points you keep,
        and the bonus of Participant C will be the points you return.
