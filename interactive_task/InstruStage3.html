    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Interaction with a participant from another study</p>

    <p>
        Now, you are matched with <b>a new participant from a different study</b>.
        We refer to this participant as "Participant C".
        Participant C will see <u>only one</u> of your randomly selected die rolls,
        <u>as well as</u> the number you reported for that roll.
    </p>

    <p>
        {{ if treatment == 'TG' }}
        Just like in stage 2,
        {{ endif }} based on this information, after learning how many times you reported the correct number,
        they will have <b>the opportunity to send you up to 3 points</b>.
        Every point they send is <u>tripled</u> by the computer: <b>1 point sent becomes 3 points received</b>.
        Then, you decide how many points from those, if any, to return to this other participant.
        <u>You can return nothing, some, or all points</u>.
    </p>

    <div class="card bg-light instructions">
        <div class="card-body" style="font-size: 14px">
        Example:
        <ul>
            <li>If they send all 3 points, you will receive 9 points.
            <li>If you return half of the 9 points, you and Participant C will both earn 4.5 points,
            and will both have more than you started with.
            <li>If you return nothing, they will earn 9 points, while you will earn nothing.
        </ul>
        </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
        Your bonus will be the points you keep,
        and the bonus of Participant C will be the points you return.
