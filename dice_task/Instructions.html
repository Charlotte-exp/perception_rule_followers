    <p>
        This study is made of two stages:
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <b>first stage</b>, you will have the opportunity to roll a die.
        You must then report the number you rolled.
        The number of points you report is the number of points you will be paid.
        <b>1 point is worth {{ C.conversion }}</b>.
        You repeat this five times, with a new die roll each time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <b>second stage</b>, after the five die roll, you are <b>matched with another participant</b> from another study.
        The other participant will see one of your die roll selected at random and the number you reported for that roll.
        Based on this, the other participant will choose how many points to send to you from zero to three.
        These points are <b>tripled</b> by us before they reach you.
        Your task is to decide, for each possible points sent by the other participant,
        how many to send back to them and how many to keep to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>To summarise</b>: You get two bonus: one from the die number you report,
        and one from the points you receive and keep from the other participant.
        Because the other participant will be matched with you in a later study, y
        ou will receive your bonus later.
