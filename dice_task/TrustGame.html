            In this task, we will ask you to tell us what you would do in different similar scenarios

            Another participant in another study will see your choices from the dice task.
            Based on this, they will decide how many points, if any, they wish to send to you.
            The points they decide to send are doubled/tripled, while those they keep are not.
            You can send how many of those points back at this participant.
            Your choices will be combined once both experiments have been run,
            and you will be paid according to both your choices
        </p>
        <p>
            Below we are asking you to tell us how much you would want to send back depending on how much you received.
