    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Stage 2: Interaction with another participant in the study</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After the {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} die rolls,
        you are <b>matched with another participant</b> from the same study.
        <li>You will the number of times the other participant reported the correct number,
        and they will see the number of times <u>you</u> reported the correct number.

        <li>You will be paid a {{ C.bonus }} points bonus if your rating is the same as the most common answer for that participant.
        {{ endif }}

        {{ if player.treatment == 'TG' }}

        <li>You will be paid two separate bonus points based on that interaction ranging from 0 to 9 points.
        {{ endif }}

    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Stage 3: Extra interaction with a participant from another study</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After stage 2 is over,
        you are matched with a <b>new participant from a different study</b>.
        <li>The other participant will now see <u>only one</u> of your randomly selected die roll,
        <u>as well as</u> the number you reported for that roll.

    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>To summarise</b>: You get three bonus, one from the die number you report,
        two from the interaction in stage 2, and one from the interaction in stage 3.
        Because the 3rd participant will be matched with you in a later study,
        you will receive both bonuses later.
